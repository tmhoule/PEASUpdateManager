# PEASUpdateManager

The PEASUpdateManager allows end user clients to 'Opt-In' to our patch management program by checking a box in this application.  
The Checkbox setting will be saved into a plist which is read into the JSS by by an Extension Attribute.  We can then target those users for updates.
